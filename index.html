            <p>"Let me congratulate you on your election as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of Bangladesh delegation’s full cooperation throughout the Session. 
            <br>
            I would also place on record our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, for his unwavering commitment to deliver on the UN mandates and address the global challenges. 
            <br>
            I particularly applaud his vision in convening the Summit of the Future. <br>The Pact for the Future and the Declaration on Future Generations could help in setting pathways beyond Agenda 2030. Bangladesh believes that the Summit’s outcome will serve as a guiding framework in materializing our shared aspirations and re-thinking collaboration, for posterity." </p>
